# ZOO SPECIES CLASSIFICATION USING NEURAL NETWORKS

This project focuses on classifying different zoo animal species using the [Orange Data Mining](https://orangedatamining.com/) tool, a visual programming platform for machine learning and data visualization.

### ðŸ“Œ Project Workflow

1. **Data Loading & Exploration**

   * Imported the Zoo dataset containing various animal attributes (hair, feathers, eggs, milk, etc.).
   * Used **Data Info** and **Data Table** widgets to inspect data structure and attribute details.

2. **Preprocessing**

   * Cleaned and prepared data using the **Preprocess** widget for normalization and feature selection.

3. **Model Training**

   * Implemented multiple classification algorithms:

     * **kNN (k-Nearest Neighbors)**
     * **Neural Network**
     * **SVM (Support Vector Machine)**

4. **Model Evaluation**

   * Used **Test & Score** to evaluate models on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
   * Analyzed results with **Confusion Matrix** to compare classifier performance.

5. **Visualization**

   * Generated **Scatter Plots** and **Image Viewer** outputs to visualize class separations and patterns.

### ðŸŽ¯ Goal

The goal is to build and compare different ML models to accurately classify animals into their correct species groups based on their features.

### ðŸ›  Tools & Technologies

* **Orange Data Mining Tool** (Visual Programming)
* kNN, Neural Networks, SVM classifiers
* Data preprocessing, evaluation metrics, and visualization
